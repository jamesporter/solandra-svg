# solandra-svg

## This website

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## The Plan

Core, relevant bits of Solandra applied to SVG for static renders. Include html-ish stuff like classes, ids. Do groups, layers, ...

Don't do fill/draw separately (as Solandra)

Main short term goal is for plotting type stuff.

Keep it minimal

Output in various ways: inital focus preview/sketch-book + svg file (or something equiv)

Probably just support svg, path and g(roup)
